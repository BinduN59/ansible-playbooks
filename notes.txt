docker container cp /home/bindu/test.sh harsha:/test.sh
docker container cp sourcedir container:destdir
docker container create : always requires an --env variable in order for the container to be up and running.
docker container create --name test --env app_env=production nginx
docker container diff : Inspects into the container and provides changes/existing files/packages

docker container export testdiff > test.tar
docker container export -o test.tar testdiff
docker container export testdiff | tar -xvf -

docker import anyzipfile imagename:latest


docker restart: can start both stopped and running containers

 docker container run -d --name aditya -p 8586:80 nginx => web packages , port forwarding is mandatory and only runs in the background

 docker container run -it --name aditya -p 8586:80 ubuntu => OS image , port forwarding is optional -it: intearactive terminal

 docker container stats =>  Displays memory, CPU % and number of PIDs
 PIDS are directly proportional to heap area/memory  (very important)
  may result in restarting the docker continuously

docker container top <container name> => displays all processes running in the container with process id and parent process id , CPU . start time and terminal associated with process



docker network :

inspect : 
disconnect: 

docker run -it --name develop --hostname admin --network harsha --ip 10.20.1.5 ubuntu:24.04


Restart n containers in exited state
for container in $(docker ps -a -q -f "status=exited"); do
  docker container start "$container"
done

ps: -f is forcefully

Stop n containers

for i in $(docker ps -aq); do
  docker container stop "$i"

 nginx -t (verifies if nginx is running)

 Replication controller
 Replica set  --> It is next gen of Replication controller . Replica set will also manages pod life cycle. It can scale up and scale down pod. Only diff comes in its selector support.
 Daemon set
 Deployment

package information of a name space:
kubectl get all -n kube-system

kubectl delete -f replica.yaml
replicationcontroller "java-webapp-rc" deleted
service "rep-service" deleted

By running the above command using file name , we can delete rc and svc at the same time.

replica set and daemon set diff . Daemon set doesnt accept replicas option in yaml file.

 kubectl delete all --all

 kubectl get pods -n bindu [here -n refers to namespace]

 replicationcontroller : labels
 replicaset: matchLabels , replicas (pods count)
 DaemonSet: matchLabels, no replicas are mentioned in yaml

 kubectl get all -o wide


ClusterIP will not change , if service is updated. However , a mew IP is issued , when a service is deleted and recreated.
ETCD (database) is where the pod lifecycle/info is stored. ETCD is one of the databases in kubernetes and can determine the Pods health.

container always starts from kubelet

pod eviction: pod will be running successfully once, and when the worker node is downtime or out of resources, network failure 
              In this case new pod might not be up. even image is pulled , the pod will not be created.
pod terminating: comes during when pod is dying due to overload or network failure (mainly through disaster)

Pods :
   watch kubectl get pods
Service:
  ClusterIP: default
  nodeport: staticIP
  loadbalancer: two pods with same port number and can also have static IP
Replication controller: Can only run application.
                        kubectl describe rc <rc metadata name>
                        kubectl scale rc testrc --replicas 4 ; scale up and down replicas
                        kubectl get pods --show-labels

Replicaset: Can also browse image , not only application.
            kubectl describe rs <rs metadata name> ; describes complete replication set.
            kubectl exec demo-repset-jmgz5 -- ls ; run a command without logging into pod
            kubectl exec <podname> -c <containername> -- pwd; specifies the path of the container
            kubectl logs <podname> ; provides logs for that pod
Deployment:
            kubectl get deploymentskube
            kubectl rollout history deployment javawebappdeployment --revision 2 ; specifies the revision
            kubectl rollout undo deployment javawebappdeployment --to-revision=2; rolls back to revision 2
            kubectl set image deployment javawebappdeployment javawebappcontainer=dockerhandson/java-web-app:2 --record ; updates image background only , not in the file.
    
HPA: Horizontal pod autoscaler ; it will  scales up/down no.of  pod replicas of deployment , RC , RS dynamically based on the metrics of CPU and memory utilization
Daemonsets: 
             kubectl get ds

Load generator:
kubectl run -it --rm loadgenerator --image=busybox ; this commands creates a new pod(group of containers) , with an image called busy box, --rm means remove loadgenerator name
wget -q -O- http://hpaservice   ; wget -q -O- http://<service name> , to call the service locally
once exit command is used , the loadgenerator pod is deleted .more info below:
  Session ended, resume using 'kubectl attach loadgenerator -c loadgenerator -i -t' command when the pod is running ; this will not work if the pod is deleted.
  pod "loadgenerator" deleted
